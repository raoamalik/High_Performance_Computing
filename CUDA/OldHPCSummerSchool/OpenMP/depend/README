Illustrates how OpenMP directives can introduce bugs in this instance
by asserting that iterations of a loop can run in parallel even when a
dependency between iterations is very visible.

Elements of an array [0..N-1] are initialized to i and then the partial sums 

 sum(j=0..i) a[j]

are computed by accumulating into the same array.  Finally, the last
element is printed out which should have value N*(N-1)/2.

The various files are the original sequential version, different
parallel for loop schedules (static, dynamic, guided), and finally 
an ordered parallel for.
