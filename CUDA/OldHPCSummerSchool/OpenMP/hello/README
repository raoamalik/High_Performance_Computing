Hello world and related programs to illustrate effect and nesting of
parallel and parallel_for.  Also use of some of the OpenMP API.

Think about effects of the environment variables
  OMP_NUM_THREADS (set from 1 to 32=default)
  OMP_NESTED (set to FALSE=default or TRUE)

hello ... parallel section printing thread id and #threads

hello_for ... parallel for loop printing thread id and #threads

setvec ... sequential simple for loop ... add 1 line to file to
           parallelize the initialization loop

num_thr ... prints out #threads in main line code

num_thr_parallel ... prints out #threads in parallel section

num_thr_nested ... prints out #threads in nested parallel section

num_thr_nested2 ... prints out #threads in nested parallel sections
