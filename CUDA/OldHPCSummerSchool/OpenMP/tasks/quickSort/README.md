Program sorts a list of random numbers using a quick sort algorithm.

After downloading, simply type "make" to install. Note: c++11 may be required for the clocks. gcc is the default compiler (if you use another compiler, you may need to change the -fopenmp tag in the Makefile).

"quickSort" is the executable. Arguments are as follows:

1. The size of the list of random numbers you wish to generate.
2. The smallest number in the range of random numbers to be generated.
3. The largest number in the range of random numbers to be generated.

To use the quickSort() function in your personal program, simply add quick_sort.h and quick_sort.tpp to your program. Then, #include "quick_sort.h" in the file you wish to use it in.
