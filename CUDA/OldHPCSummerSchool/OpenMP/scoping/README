default ... parallel section with default scope (=shared)
[what is the scope of c?]

default-none ... parallel section with default scope set to none
             ... compilation should FAIL

private ... illustrates lack of global effect of setting private variables

private2 ... illustrates that private variables are default (not) initialized

firstprivate ... illlustrates how to copy shared state into a private variable

private3 ... illustrates (again but now with a loop) that state of
             private variables is not copied out

lastprivate ... illustrates how to copy out the state of the last iteration
