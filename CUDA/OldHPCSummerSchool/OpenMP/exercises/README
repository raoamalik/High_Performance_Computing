0)  Read the Intel and GNU compiler documentation for OpenMP,
    the OpenMP specification, reference card, and examples.

1)  Write from scratch hello world with various parallel constructs
    ... parallel, parallel setions, parallel for, nesting constructs

2)  Employ different loop orders and parallel strategies to parallelize
    the MxM code ... try to get good parallel scaling ... and
    understand why

3)  Parallelize one or more of the HF.V3, VMC, MD, MC_fortran codes

4)  Take Ed's Daxpy benchmark and parallelize it ... explain the performance
    you see as a function of vector length and number of threads.

5)  What is false sharing?  Can U write a code with that problem?

6)  Time critical/atomic/reduction strategies for summation and explain
    the observed behavior.

7)  Work on some of your own code

8)  Review some of the other online tutorials in the links
