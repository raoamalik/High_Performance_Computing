This program computes expectation values (6D integrals) associated with the helium atom.  Define r1, r2, and r12 to be the distances of electrons from the nucleus and from each other, the classic Hylleraas wavefunction for the helium atom is

   psi(r1,r2,r12) = (1 + 0.5*r12) * exp(-2*(r1+r2))

We want to compute <r1>, <r2>, <r12> where

   <f> = integral( f(r1,r2,r12) * psi(r1,r2,r12)^2 dx1 dy1 dz1 dx2 dy2 dz2) / N

where N is the constant that square normalizes psi.

This is performed using the Metropolis algorithm that interprets
p=psi^2 as an unormalized probability distribution.  Points are
asymptotically sampled from the distribution p() as follows

0) initialize vectors r1 and r2 and compute p

repeat 1) and 2) 

1) randomly sample new vectors r1, r2 and compute pnew

2) accept the new point with probablilty min(1,p/pnew)

once the population has converged (in this simple example
we assume this happens after Neq steps) you can start computing
statistics.
