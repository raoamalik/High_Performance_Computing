Incremental transformation from sequential to parallel

1) Insert MPI_Init and finalize, restrict printing to node zero only
   ... but still running sequentially

2) Mmm ... now need to think.  How are we going to parallelize this?

   Let's replicate the particles since distributing them is much more
   complicated (and more efficient!).

   Since evaluation of the forces is driven by the neighborlist we can
   have each node compute just a subset of the neighborlist and then 
   do a global sum so that everyone has all of the forces.

   What are the potential problems here?

2a) Prolly need to broadcast the initial coords and velocities to ensure 
    everyone starting from the same place
   
3) Restrict computation of the neighbor list to a subset of particles
   per node and introduce a global sum into the forces

   .. oh and don't forget to global sum the virial and pe also
