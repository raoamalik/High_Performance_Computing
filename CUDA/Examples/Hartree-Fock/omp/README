Incremental transformation approach to getting OpenMP working

1) What is the most expensive thing?  The direct two-electron Fock build

2) So let's parallelize that.  But first add some timing measurement.

   include omp.h, instrument code

   let's also get rid of printing the matrices which will get big

3) parallelize entirety of fock build using counter-mod mechanism

   why is count a long?  is there a better solution?
   
   use multiple G arrays to avoid dependency

   use unique engine per thread since integral code NOT thread safe


Exercises

  - repeat the above steps for yourself to be sure you understand

  - what are the good and bad points of our approach?

  - see what happens if you use just one integral engine shared
    by all threads

  - parallelize 1-electon parts of the code

  - parallelize 2-electron part using a parallel outer for loop

  - parallelize 2-electron part using nested parallel for loops

  - use just 1 G matrix for all threads ... what should be in
    the critical section for correct AND efficient execution?
